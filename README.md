# SIG23 - USD In Production - Course Code
This repository contains complementary code for the course slides used on the `Coding for Interactive USD Editing` section of the `USD In Production` course for SIGGRAPH-2023.

The aim is to facilitate the exploration and testing of the key concepts presented at the course, with each module extending from the previous one progressively.

Software versions tested against are `python-3.7`, `USD-21.11` to `USD-22.05` and, for the USDView example, `mayaUSD-0.20` and `mayaUSD-0.23`.
